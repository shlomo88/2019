# Zimbabwe CTF 2019

## The first ever Zimbabwe Capture the Flag (CTF) contest for Cybersecurity Month 2019

For the first time ever, the [Harare Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.ac.zw), the [Ministry of Information and Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services](http://www.ictministry.gov.zw/) (MICTPCS), [TelOne](https://www.telone.co.zw/) and [ZICT](http://zict.org.zw/), the ICT Division of the [Zimbabwe Institution of Engineers](http://zie.org.zw/) (ZIE) will be organizing this exciting event that has taken the cyberspace domain by storm! 

### What is a CTF??

**CTF** is short for _Capture The Flag_ and it is a kind of cyber security contest that challenges participants to solve a variety of cyber-related tasks ranging from analyzing captured network data for secret information, to hacking your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text or a file that may be hidden on the server or behind a webpage. That hidden data or file is called the flag, hence the name, CTF!

### Who is the CTF open to?

It is open to **all** people who work in or have an interest in the field of cybersecurity, regardless of their years of experience.

The beauty of CTFs is that they give _student hackers_, security professionals and enthusiasts as well as hobbyists an opportunity to try out a variety of hacking challenges and basically test their skill level. As most people know, cybersecurity is a domain that affects everyone and the more you have a practical understanding of how attacks can be performed, the easier it is for you to help other people understand how real the threat is.

### Do we have to register to participate?

Yes you will have to register online via [this link](https://forms.gle/cPVf8oWbD5ymSEN18). Please note that the challenges will only be availed to registered teams and only registered teams will be up to win prizes.

### Oh, so there are prizes to be won?

Yes there are! The winning team will be awarded a prize and they will also have the bragging rights as the winners of the **first ever** Zim CTF Contest.

### Can we sign up as a team?

Yes, you can. The sizes of the teams that can attempt the challenge can range from One person to a maximum of Four individuals per team. 

### How will the Finalists and Winners be determined?

There will be a set of challenges that will need to be completed as is the standard model with CTFs. In this case, it will be time-based, so the first team to complete the challenge, submit a flag and the accompanying report of how they completed the challenge will be the victor.

### We will also have to submit a report?

Yes, the coordinators of the CTF will need to get a report from you on the steps you took in order to overcome the challenges. A standard template will be shared with registered teams. If your team would prefer to submit the report in video format, we can also accommodate that as well.

### Where will the CTF be hosted?

The CTF model we are using has two phases:
- `Phase 1`: This will involve the Entry Round and Elimination Round challenges which will all be done by teams remotely and online.
- `Phase 2`: This will be onsite in Harare where the Top Five teams will battle it out to see who becomes the winner.
